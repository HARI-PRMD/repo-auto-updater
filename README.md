# repo-auto-updater

I will have this ready at some point or the other ...

anyways the problem is that I usually have to manually `git pull` and restart my discord bot on my local server whenever I push changes to main branch of my repo. this is annoying. I need to make small tool that uses github's webhook to watch for changes instead of searching up the internet for pre-existing solutions just because (insert reason).
